## Overview

This flood forecasting and vulnerability mapping system supports disaster preparedness planning by visualising exposure and vulnerability indicators across flood-prone areas. The map enables planners to identify at-risk populations and infrastructure before flood events occur.

## Key Features

- **Vulnerability indicators** - Extracted from OpenStreetMap infrastructure data
- **Flood exposure zones** - Areas at risk during different flood scenarios
- **Population density** - Understanding who is at risk
- **Critical infrastructure** - Schools, hospitals, and evacuation routes

## Technology Stack

- **GeoServer** - Web map service delivery and styling
- **PostgreSQL/PostGIS** - Spatial data storage and analysis
- **OpenStreetMap** - Base infrastructure data
- **OpenLayers** - Web mapping interface

## Disaster Risk Reduction

Forecast-based action enables authorities to take preventative measures before floods occur, reducing loss of life and property damage through early warning and targeted interventions.
