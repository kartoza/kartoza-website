## Training at The African Quaternary Conference

Kartoza recently concluded a three-day introductory QGIS training session offered at no cost during The African Quaternary: Environments, Ecology and Humans conference held in Cape Town. Kelly Kirsten from the University of Cape Town's organizing committee extended the invitation. Admire Nyakudya instructed approximately fifteen conference participants from various countries. Participants used QGIS 2.6.1 on personal laptops running their preferred operating systems.

The attendee group had varied experience levels—some already utilized QGIS, others encountered it for the first time, and some wished to compare it with ArcGIS. The instruction drew primarily from the "QGIS training manual" but was customized according to "the requirements, interests and pace of the class."

The post includes two photographs from the training event.
