## Overview

The FBIS mobile app supports data entry for fish, invertebrates, algae, anurans, and plants in both rivers and wetlands, including SASS (South African Scoring System) biomonitoring data for rivers.

The app connects to the FBIS web platform, enabling field researchers to capture biodiversity observations with GPS coordinates and sync data back to the central database.
