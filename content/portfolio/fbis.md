## Overview

The Freshwater Biodiversity Information System (FBIS) is a platform for hosting, visualising and sharing freshwater biodiversity information for South African rivers. The system manages data on species occurrence, abundance, and habitat parameters for freshwater algae, invertebrates, and fish.

It provides spatial and temporal filtering capabilities for water resource managers, biodiversity planners, researchers, and consultants working with South Africa's freshwater ecosystems.
