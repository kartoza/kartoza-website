## Overview

This practical course introduces participants to Python programming for geospatial applications. Participants will learn fundamental Python programming concepts and how to apply them to GIS workflows using popular libraries including GDAL/OGR, Shapely, Fiona, Rasterio, GeoPandas, and PyQGIS. The course covers spatial data manipulation, automated geoprocessing, spatial analysis, coordinate transformations, and integration with databases and web services. Through hands-on exercises, participants will develop scripts to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex spatial analysis, and build custom geospatial tools. No prior programming experience is required, making this course accessible to GIS professionals seeking to enhance their technical skills.
