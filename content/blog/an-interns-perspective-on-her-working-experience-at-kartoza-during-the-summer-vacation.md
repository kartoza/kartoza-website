## Overview

Kartoza, a Free and Open Source GIS organization in South Africa, actively recruits talented students for internship and vacation work programs. The company aims to promote open-source geospatial solutions in regions where proprietary software dominates educational institutions.

## Intern Profile

Natalia Dambe, pursuing a Master's degree in Geomatics at the University of Cape Town, completed a four-week summer internship at Kartoza. Her experience exemplifies the company's commitment to developing emerging talent in the GIS sector.

## Primary Projects

Dambe focused on map styling, specifically migrating legacy styles to accommodate NGI vector data architecture changes. She utilized the QGIS Training Workshop materials to develop foundational skills while conducting quality assurance documentation reviews.

## Technical Skills Acquired

Her daily responsibilities introduced her to:
- SpatiaLite database management
- Geoserver and QGIS Server map publishing
- Leaflet and OpenLayers web mapping libraries via QGIS2web plugin
- Remote sensing tools including GRASS GIS, QGIS Processing Framework, and semi-automated classification plugins

## Professional Development

Beyond technical competencies, Dambe developed communication, interpersonal skills, and problem-solving abilities through interaction with multinational staff from Zimbabwe, Indonesia, Zambia, and South Africa. She credited mentor Admire Nyakudya and directors Gavin Fleming, Tim Sutton, and Christian Christelis for fostering a supportive learning environment that enhanced both professional growth and career networking opportunities.
