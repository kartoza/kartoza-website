## Overview

Kartoza developed a free, curated global healthcare location database in collaboration with Mark Herringer. Partnered with the International Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, the platform publishes healthcare location data that demands the highest standards of quality and accuracy.

The system uses docker-osm technology to mirror OpenStreetMap data, automatically submitting captured health facility information to OpenStreetMap's API while maintaining a local PostgreSQL database.
