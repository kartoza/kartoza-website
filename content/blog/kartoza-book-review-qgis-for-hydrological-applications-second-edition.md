## Main Content

The reviewer emphasizes that this publication transcends its hydrological focus, asserting it serves "anyone who wants to improve their QGIS skills through practical, real-world examples."

The author describes meeting the book's creators at FOSS4G 2022 and subsequently reviewing the work. The publication contains eight chapters structured as a progressive workflow:

- Preparing Data from Hard Copy Maps
- Importing Tabular Data into QGIS
- Spatial Analysis with Map Algebra
- Stream and Catchment Delineation
- Adding Open Data to Your Catchment
- Calculating Percentage of Land Cover per Subcatchment
- Map Design and Conclusion

## Key Review Points

Each chapter opens with methodology workflows applicable beyond QGIS software. The exercises feature detailed color screenshots and step-by-step instructions. The reviewer notes supplementary video tutorials by Hans van der Kwast enhance the learning experience.

The structure culminates in developing "pleasing and functional map" creations through accumulated competencies.
