## Why Mergin Maps?

Mergin Maps provides the complete workflow for field data collection - from project design in QGIS to data capture on mobile devices to synchronisation back to your central systems. It's the missing link between desktop GIS and field operations.

With Mergin Maps, your field teams always have the latest project versions, and collected data flows automatically back to headquarters. No more manual file transfers, version confusion, or data synchronisation headaches.

## Three-Step Workflow

### 1. Design

Create your data collection project in QGIS - the world's most powerful open source GIS. Design your base maps, set up your data layers, and build intelligent forms with validation, defaults, and conditional logic.

### 2. Sync

Push your project to Mergin Maps Cloud and invite your field teams. They'll receive the project instantly on their mobile devices, ready for data collection.

### 3. Collect

Field workers capture data using the Mergin Maps mobile app. When they sync, their data is automatically merged with everyone else's work and becomes available in QGIS for analysis.

## Perfect For

- **Large-Scale Surveys** - Coordinate dozens of field workers across wide geographic areas
- **Ongoing Monitoring** - Regular data collection campaigns with consistent methodology
- **Asset Inventories** - Systematic capture of infrastructure, facilities, or natural resources
- **Community Mapping** - Participatory data collection involving local stakeholders
- **Environmental Monitoring** - Water sampling, biodiversity surveys, pollution tracking
- **Humanitarian Response** - Rapid assessment and resource mapping in emergency contexts

## Key Capabilities

### Intelligent Forms

Build sophisticated data entry forms without coding:
- Drop-down lists with cascading dependencies
- Automatic calculations and defaults
- Photo capture with compression options
- Required fields and validation rules
- Sketching and annotation tools

### Team Collaboration

- **Workgroups** - Organise field teams and control project access
- **Conflict handling** - Automatic resolution when multiple users edit the same data
- **Change tracking** - See who changed what and when
- **Selective sync** - Download only the data areas you need

### Database Integration

Connect Mergin Maps directly to your PostGIS database for real-time data integration. Changes sync automatically, keeping your central database always up to date.

### Dashboards and Reporting

Integrate with Metabase, Grafana, or other tools to visualise your field data in real-time. Track collection progress, identify gaps, and generate reports automatically.

## Case Study: WASH Survey

In 2020, Kartoza deployed Mergin Maps for a USAID-funded WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) survey in the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, South Africa.

**Challenge**: Survey over 2,000 people across 60 villages in a remote area with limited connectivity.

**Solution**: Three field workers used Mergin Maps with offline capability, syncing data when returning to base. Live dashboards via Metabase provided real-time progress tracking.

**Result**: Complete survey delivered on time with high data quality, demonstrating Mergin Maps' capability for large-scale field operations.
