## WASH Survey - Waterberg Biosphere Reserve

In 2020, Kartoza deployed Mergin Maps for a USAID-funded WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) survey in the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve. Three field workers surveyed over 2,000 people across sixty villages, with live data visualisations via Metabase and PostgreSQL integration.

This project demonstrated the power of Mergin Maps for large-scale field data collection in challenging environments.
