## Overview

Kartoza served as Project Technical Lead for an initiative addressing energy access challenges in Kenya, which had a 71% national electrification rate (94% urban, 63% rural) with 54 million residents. The endeavour sought to integrate electricity and clean cooking planning.

The platform expanded the OnStove tool to Kenya as an open-source platform for analysing energy supply and demand data, supporting investment decisions for clean cooking and electricity access.
