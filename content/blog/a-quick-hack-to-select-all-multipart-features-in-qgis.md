## Identifying Multipart Features

The post describes a technique for identifying multipart features within a QGIS vector layer. The author explains that they needed to locate all multipart features in their dataset and developed a quick solution using QGIS's Python console.

The article includes two screenshots showing the process: the first displays a map layer, and the second shows the results after running the code, with multipart features highlighted.

## Instructions

The instructions are straightforward:

1. Ensure a vector layer is active in the layer list
2. Paste Python code into the Python console
3. All multipart features will be highlighted for visualization

The piece concludes with a comment section allowing readers to engage with the content.
