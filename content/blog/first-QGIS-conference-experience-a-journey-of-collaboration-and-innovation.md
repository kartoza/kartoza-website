## My first QGIS Conference Experience: A Journey of Collaboration and Innovation

From September 9th to 13th, the author attended the QGIS User Conference, followed by the Contributors Meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia. As a QGIS full-stack web developer funded by QGIS and accompanied by Selma Vidimlić Husić (QGIS documentation writer), this event provided opportunities to connect with contributors and the broader QGIS community.

### The Conference

Held at the Slovak University of Technology (STU), the conference brought together 240 participants globally. Over two days, attendees participated in more than 50 talks and 15 workshops covering QGIS development, innovation, and community engagement.

Anita Graser, QGIS Project Steering Committee Vice-chair, delivered the keynote addressing the project's evolution.

A particularly notable workshop was "Hands-on qgis-js: Build interactive QGIS-based Maps from Scratch" by Michael Schmuki. This session introduced qgis-js—a project bringing QGIS capabilities into browsers using WebAssembly, enabling interactive web maps with QGIS functionality without leaving the browser.

### Our Talk: Spotlighting Key Roles in the QGIS Community

The author co-presented "Presentation of Two QGIS Roles: QGIS Documentation Writer and QGIS Full Stack Web Developer" with Selma Vidimlić Husić. The presentation highlighted maintaining QGIS project websites and documentation, sharing daily workflows, challenges, and encouraging community participation.

### Networking

Beyond formal sessions, informal discussions enriched the experience. The conference dinner on a Danube river boat provided networking opportunities. Meeting past Kartoza team members, including Ismail Sunni and Etienne Trimaille, proved particularly memorable.

### Contributor Meeting: Collaborative Work and Future Goals

The three-day Contributors Meeting facilitated collaboration with community leaders including Andreas Neuman, Ujaval Gandhi, Hans van der Kwast, and Kurt Menke. Discussions focused on the QGIS website and Certification Website.

### Exploring Bratislava

Beyond conference activities, the author explored Bratislava with Selma, visiting the old town and Bratislava Castle, enjoying citywide views.

### Thank You to the QGIS Community

The author expressed gratitude to the Slovak QGIS User Group for organizing the event, QGIS for funding, and Tim Sutton and the Kartoza Team for their support.
