## Overview

This web map recreates the iconic look and feel of South Africa's official NGI (National Geo-spatial Information) topographical sheets at 1:50,000 scale. Using QGIS's advanced cartographic capabilities, we've translated the classic paper map aesthetic into a modern, interactive web format.

## Key Features

- **Authentic styling** - Faithful reproduction of NGI colour schemes and symbology
- **Multi-scale display** - Appropriate detail levels at different zoom scales
- **Contour lines** - Terrain representation maintaining traditional topo map appearance
- **Feature labelling** - Place names and geographic features in familiar presentation

## Cartographic Heritage

South Africa's 1:50,000 topographical map series has served generations of users, from hikers and farmers to engineers and planners. This digital homage preserves that cartographic tradition while making it accessible via modern web technology.

## Technology

Created in QGIS and published as a web map, this demonstrates how desktop GIS styling can be accurately translated to web formats while maintaining cartographic quality.
