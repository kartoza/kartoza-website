## Content

The author provides a comprehensive overview of the inaugural QGIS User Conference and Developer Meeting held in Nødebo, Denmark. He opens by extending gratitude to organizer Lene Fischer and the University of Copenhagen School of Forestry for hosting the event at their forest venue.

## Key Highlights

### Conference Sessions

Fleming presented on "the future of QGIS" in a town hall format, featuring discussions on desktop, server, and mobile development. The conference attracted approximately 150 attendees.

### Notable Technical Developments

- Geometry checking tools created by Sourcepole's Sandro Mani
- Enhanced processing framework capabilities
- Server-side plugin architecture by Alessandro Pasotti
- New geometry system supporting curves and 3D coordinates
- Headless/command-line QGIS applications
- QField mobile platform for Android field work
- Advanced cartographic rendering and variable-based expression tools

### Major Decision

Regarding QGIS 3.0 release timing, the leadership stated: "we don't know" when it will launch, pending investigation into Qt5 and Python 3 compatibility implications.

## Future Initiatives

Two significant projects emerged—an official user certification program and formation of a QGIS legal entity.
