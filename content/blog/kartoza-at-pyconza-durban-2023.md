Kartoza participated in PyConZA 2023, presenting on leveraging Python in geospatial applications with real-world project examples.
{{< /block >}}

## Opening

Kartoza maintains an active role in creating advanced geospatial solutions, with Python as a cornerstone of major product development.

## Event Overview

The author and colleague Eli participated in PyConZA, a hybrid conference hosting over 50 attendees at Premier Splendid Inn Umhlanga in Durban. The venue provided "nice aerial views from the 10th floor."

## Main Topics Covered

Three broad categories emerged:

1. Python applications for database management (PostgreSQL)
2. Data pipeline processing
3. Best practices and anti-patterns for Python application development

## Presenter's Talk Focus

Admire delivered a presentation titled "Leveraging Python in GeoSpatial Applications," drawing from real-world projects including the SAGTA MapDownloader and spatial data infrastructure for ECOWAS electrical infrastructure management.

## Key Presentation Points

The talk addressed:

- Automating data loading from diverse sources into normalized databases using Python scripts within QGIS
- Creating custom Python functions for QGIS form constraints
- Developing Python actions to automate QGIS processes accessible via attribute tables
- Practical workflows demonstrating QGIS form setup, mobile data capture through MerginMaps, database synchronization, and GeoNode-based SDI integration

## Conclusion

"Python as a programming language is very powerful and can be used in many ways," illustrated through diverse applications including household automation monitoring.
