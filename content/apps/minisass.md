## Overview

The miniSASS app is an easy-to-use citizen science tool that helps users assess the health and water quality of rivers and streams. Based on the South African Scoring System (SASS), miniSASS simplifies the process so that anyone can contribute to water quality monitoring.

Users collect aquatic macroinvertebrate samples and use the app to identify and score them, generating a water quality assessment that is uploaded to a central database for researchers and water managers.
