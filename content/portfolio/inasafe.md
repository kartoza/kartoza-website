## Overview

InaSAFE is an open-source disaster planning tool that helps governments quickly model potential impacts of floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, fires, and hurricanes. The system combines hazard and exposure data to estimate disaster impacts and produce actionable reports.

## Components

### InaSAFE Plugin
A QGIS desktop plugin co-developed with DMInnovation enabling rapid scenario assessments. Users can run simulations locally, create impact maps, and export PDF reports detailing affected areas and estimated consequences.

### InaSAFE Realtime
An automated server-side system delivering near real-time impact estimates following major disaster events. It ingests hazard data and generates cartographic outputs within minutes for emergency operations centres.

### GeoSAFE
A web-based interface built on GeoNode allowing users to conduct analyses via browsers without desktop GIS software. Supports collaborative scenario planning across agencies.
