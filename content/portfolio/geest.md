## Overview

The Gender Enabling Environments Spatial Tool (GEEST) leverages geospatial data to identify and address barriers to employment for women. Developed as a QGIS plugin, it generates spatial insights on transportation, education, digital inclusion, and socio-economic conditions affecting workforce participation.

The final phase refined the tool by incorporating comprehensive demographic factors to deliver actionable insights supporting inclusive workforce development.
