{{< /block >}}

## Introduction

The piece serves as an instructional guide for geography educators implementing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software in their curricula. It addresses the intersection of modern geography and spatial problem-solving through accessible technology.

## GIS Software Section

The article emphasizes zero-cost options like "QGIS, Mergin Maps and QField" are available to schools. A practical suggestion encourages teachers to have students independently install and explore software, allowing peer-to-peer learning.

### QGIS Details

- Described as "a free and open source desktop GIS that allows users to create, edit, visualise, analyse and publish geospatial information"
- Two release versions available: Long-Term Release (stable, fewer features) and Current Release (latest functionality, potentially less stable)
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux with unlimited installation rights

### Mobile Options

- Mergin Maps functions as a mobile QGIS version for field data collection
- QField presented as a comparable alternative

## Getting Help Section

Resources identified include the QGIS user guide with tutorials and exercises. Additionally, "Introduction to GIS in the Classroom" course targets South African educators across intermediate through FET phase levels.

## Maps and Data Section

### Vector Data

OpenStreetMap (OSM) identified as a "global Open Data platform" where students can map neighborhoods. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team offers volunteer mapping opportunities.

### Raster Data

NASA provides free Digital Elevation Models and satellite imagery through account registration. Tools like SRTM-downloader assist educators teaching elevation visualization. Digital Earth Africa provides aerial imagery, water, and temperature datasets via Web Map Service integration.

### Additional Resources

- SAGTA (Southern African Geography Teachers' Association) Map Downloader recommended for classroom exercises
- Geospatial Data Science Certificate program available through University of Pretoria partnership
