## Why QField?

QField is the leading open source mobile GIS application, designed to bring the full power of QGIS to your field teams. Unlike simplified mobile mapping apps, QField preserves your complete QGIS project - including complex styling, advanced forms, and sophisticated data models.

Whether you're conducting environmental surveys, asset inspections, or community mapping, QField provides the professional tools you need in a mobile-friendly interface.

## Perfect For

- **Environmental Surveys** - Biodiversity monitoring, habitat mapping, water sampling
- **Asset Management** - Infrastructure inspections, maintenance logging, condition assessments

- **Planning** - Site assessments, land use surveys, community mapping
- **Emergency Response** - Damage assessments, resource tracking, incident mapping

## Key Capabilities

### Seamless QGIS Integration

Your desktop QGIS projects work directly in QField. No need to recreate styling, redesign forms, or simplify your data model. What you see in QGIS is what your field teams get on their devices.

### Advanced Data Collection

- Attribute forms with validation, defaults, and dependencies
- Sketching and photo capture with automatic geotagging
- Relationship editing for linked tables
- Expression-based fields and calculations
- Barcode and QR code scanning

### Precision Positioning

Connect external GNSS receivers via Bluetooth for centimetre-level accuracy. QField supports all major positioning protocols and displays real-time accuracy information.

### Flexible Synchronisation

Work completely offline in remote areas, then synchronise when you return to connectivity. QFieldCloud provides seamless team synchronisation with conflict resolution.
