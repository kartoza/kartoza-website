## Geographic Information Systems

A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer-based tool that allows you to collect, analyse and connect location-based information and visualise this data on a map. GIS transforms raw spatial data into actionable intelligence for better decision making.

----

At Kartoza, we specialise in Free and Open Source GIS solutions that give you the freedom, transparency, and community support that proprietary software cannot match. Our expertise spans the full geospatial stack from data collection to visualisation.
