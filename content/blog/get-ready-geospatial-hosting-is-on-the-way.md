## GeoSpatialHosting Platform

Over the past year, we have been working on GeoSpatialHosting (GSH), a platform designed to make it easier to deploy and manage open-source spatial tools. Our aim is to provide a reliable and cost-effective hosting solution for GIS projects without the need for complex setup or infrastructure management.

## Current Status

We are pleased to share that the platform has now reached a production-ready stage. We are finalising the last details to ensure stability, usability and that support resources are in place before the public launch.

We are currently focussing on:

1. **Reliability testing** – running high-load simulations to confirm performance.
2. **User experience improvements** – refining the interface for smoother use.
3. **Support preparation** – creating documentation, tutorials, and troubleshooting materials.
4. **Customisation** – ensuring theming and configuration options are available for different needs.

## Products Available at Launch

The first set of tools available on the platform include:

1. G3W-Suite
2. GeoNode
3. GeoServer

These products will be offered in a range of subscription tiers to accommodate different use cases and budgets. For organisations that require a more tailored solution, our team can assist with custom configurations and deployments.

For pricing and further information, please visit [geospatialhosting.com](https://geospatialhosting.com)

## Looking Ahead

This is only the starting point. We have more tools and add-ons planned for release and we will continue to expand the platform over time.

We would also like to hear from you. If there are specific products or features you would like us to prioritise, please share your thoughts by completing our [short survey](https://forms.gle/cr5SZdMAnNRUoW6C6).
