## Opening

Amy Ternent won a copy of Kurt Menke's book at FOSS4G 2022 in Florence. She describes it as "an essential guide for any new QGIS user, a fantastic syllabus for GIS educators" and valuable for professionals. The work transitions from beginner fundamentals to advanced theory and practical exercises.

## Book Structure

The five main sections cover:

- Introduction to Geospatial Technology
- Spatial Analysis
- Data Acquisition and Management
- Cartographic Design
- Advanced Data Visualisation

The 31 chapters include standalone units allowing readers to focus on specific topics. The second edition adds seven new chapters and substantially updates seven others.

## Key New Features Reviewed

### Field Data Collection

Uses MerginMaps for mobile data gathering, connecting survey forms to cloud synchronization.

### Labels and Annotations

Enables georeferenced markings without duplicate layers, offering cartographic control.

### Temporal Controller

Facilitates animated visualizations of time-series data, including animated GIF creation.

### 3D Views

Demonstrates elevation profiles and three-dimensional mapping capabilities available in QGIS 3.26+.

## Conclusion

Ternent recommends the book particularly for GIS students and educators, noting it bridges ad hoc learning with structured knowledge.
