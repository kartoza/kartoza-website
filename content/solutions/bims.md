Comprehensive biodiversity data platform for conservation organizations. Collect, manage, and analyze species occurrence data with powerful spatial tools.
{{< /block >}}

## Overview

BIMS (Biodiversity Information Management System) is a powerful, open-source platform designed for organizations working in biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and ecological research. It provides a complete solution for collecting, managing, visualizing, and analyzing species occurrence data.

Built by Kartoza in partnership with leading conservation organizations, BIMS combines rigorous scientific data management with intuitive user interfaces and powerful spatial analysis tools. Whether you're monitoring freshwater biodiversity, tracking terrestrial species, or managing marine ecosystems, BIMS provides the tools you need.

## BIMS Implementations

### FBIS - Freshwater Biodiversity Information System

The Freshwater Biodiversity Information System is a BIMS implementation focused on freshwater ecosystems in South Africa. FBIS provides:

- Comprehensive database of freshwater species occurrences
- River health monitoring and assessment tools
- Integration with national freshwater monitoring programs
- Specialized dashboards for fish, invertebrates, and algae
- Water quality data integration

[Visit FBIS](https://freshwaterbiodiversity.org)

### RBIS - River Biodiversity Information System

Building on FBIS, RBIS extends the platform for broader river ecosystem monitoring with additional features for:

- Multi-taxa monitoring (fish, invertebrates, riparian vegetation)
- Hydrological data integration
- Ecosystem health indices
- Trend analysis over long time periods

### Custom BIMS Deployments

We deploy customized BIMS instances for:

- National parks and conservation agencies
- Research institutions and universities
- NGOs and conservation organizations
- Government environmental departments
