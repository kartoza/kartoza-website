## Overview

The FBIS (Freshwater Biodiversity Information System) basemap is a purpose-built cartographic product designed to support freshwater biodiversity research in South Africa. Unlike generic basemaps, it emphasises river networks and hydrological features that are critical for understanding aquatic ecosystems.

## Key Features

- **River-focused symbology** - Rivers and streams are prominently displayed with hierarchical styling
- **Dynamic scale switching** - Automatically transitions to TopoStyle basemap at larger scales for detailed context
- **Biodiversity context** - Designed to complement species occurrence and water quality data

## Technology Stack

- **QGIS** - Cartographic styling and design
- **GeoServer** - Web map service delivery
- **PostGIS** - Spatial data management

## Use Case

This basemap serves as the foundation for the BIMS (Biodiversity Information Management System) platform, providing researchers and conservation managers with appropriate geographic context for biodiversity data analysis.
