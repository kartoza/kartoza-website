{{< /block >}}

## Content

This educational resource targets students facing blended learning environments. The content states: "This task was designed for asynchronous self study" during South Africa's pandemic restrictions.

## Learning Objectives

The assignment asks Grade 10-12 students to digitize their home locations and neighborhoods using OpenStreetMap (OSM), then apply GIS buffer techniques to visualize a 5-kilometer exercise radius.

## Required Prerequisites

Students must download QGIS, described as "free and open and works on all devices except for iPads."

## Instructional Video Modules

1. Projections fundamentals
2. Importing OpenStreetMap layers into GIS
3. Creating vector point layers
4. Buffer geoprocessing techniques in QGIS

## Supporting Resources

The lesson references an OSM cheat sheet and installation guidance from contributor Brandon Louw. Students are directed to https://qgis.org for software access.

## Credits

The post acknowledges Bridget Fleming, described as "a senior high school Geography teacher," for contributing this pedagogical approach.
