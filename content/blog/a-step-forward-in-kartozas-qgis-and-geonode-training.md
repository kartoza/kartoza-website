## Modernizing Training Platforms

Learning online has become an essential part of education globally. Kartoza has responded to the need for current, interactive teaching materials by updating their QGIS and GeoNode training platforms. The organization uses an open source 'changelog' platform enabling continuous content updates and customization for state-of-the-art instruction.

The Kartoza Changelog functions as a comprehensive educational web platform where software projects and training courses can be organized and presented. Lessons appear in sequential sections with worksheets containing instructions and downloadable sample data, plus links to supplementary resources.

## Video Content Development

To address challenges beginners faced with initial worksheets, instructional videos were created to support self-directed learning. The intern team produced approximately sixty QGIS videos and thirty GeoNode videos. QGIS videos feature spoken step-by-step tutorials with brief explanations, while GeoNode videos use text-based instructions. Both formats allow students to follow exercises and assess comprehension.

## Platform Improvements

Additional improvements include:

- Downloadable exercise data buttons
- Enhanced worksheet information
- Simplified instructions
- Templates ensuring consistent structure across all worksheets
- Single-click worksheet creation for editors

## Future Enhancements

Further enhancements under development include:

- More visually appealing layouts with separate navigation bars
- New worksheet sections
- Varied fonts for increased flexibility and visual interest

## Integration with Moodle

Quiz functionality remains limited within Changelog; detailed feedback on correct/incorrect answers is unavailable. The Moodle platform addresses this limitation, providing course outlines, recorded sessions, assignments, quizzes, and learner progress tracking.

The intern team continues developing changelog platforms and creating content for free and open source software. Quality online education requires significant time and planning but represents education's future. Online learning effectively delivers rapid, impactful geospatial skill development.
