## Overview

This strategic course provides participants with the knowledge and tools to design, implement, and manage spatial data infrastructure (SDI) and open data initiatives. Participants will learn about SDI components, international standards and best practices, metadata creation and management, data quality assurance, licensing and legal frameworks, and organizational change management. The course combines policy, technical, and practical perspectives, ensuring participants understand both the "why" and "how" of successful SDI implementation. Through case studies and hands-on exercises, participants will develop actionable plans for implementing or improving spatial data infrastructure in their organizations.
