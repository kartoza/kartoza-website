## Overview

The Cathkin Conservancy map was created in QGIS to support conservation management in this spectacular area near the Drakensberg Mountains in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The map displays farm boundaries, natural features, and key conservation areas.

## Key Features

- **Farm boundaries** - Clear demarcation of properties within the conservancy
- **Natural features** - Rivers, vegetation, and terrain visualisation
- **Conservation zones** - Protected areas and management units
- **Infrastructure** - Roads, fences, and facilities

## Conservation Context

The Cathkin Conservancy brings together private landowners committed to sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation in the Drakensberg foothills. This map supports their coordinated management efforts.

## Technology

Created using QGIS's powerful cartographic tools, the map demonstrates how open source GIS can support professional conservation mapping requirements.
