## CyanoLakes Mobile Application

Kartoza partnered with the CyanoLakes team to develop a mobile application that enhances their existing web platform. The application leverages satellite remote sensing technology to deliver cyanobacteria health risk assessments and activity advisories aligned with World Health Organisation guidelines.

Built using React Native against the Cyanolakes web API, the app provides daily updates dependent on cloud coverage and snow/ice conditions.

## Key Features

- Add and manage lakes from anywhere globally
- Health risk level assessments for water activities
- Daily satellite data updates

## Upcoming Features (Version 2)

- Forecasts
- High-resolution maps
- Notifications and alerts
- Enhanced data from Copernicus Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2

The application is freely available on both Android and iOS platforms via official app stores.
