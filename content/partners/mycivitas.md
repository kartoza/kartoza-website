## Why MyCivitas?

Infrastructure is your organisation's largest investment. Water networks, roads, buildings, and facilities represent billions in value and are essential for service delivery. Yet many organisations lack basic visibility into their asset portfolio - what they own, its condition, and when it will need attention.

MyCivitas provides that visibility. By combining spatial data management with asset lifecycle best practices, MyCivitas enables data-driven decisions about infrastructure spending - helping you get maximum value from limited budgets.

## Built for Municipalities

MyCivitas was designed specifically for local government and utility requirements:

- **Multiple Asset Types** - Water, wastewater, stormwater, roads, buildings, parks, fleet
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Meet reporting requirements for asset management plans
- **Budget Integration** - Link asset needs to financial planning and budgeting
- **Service Delivery** - Connect infrastructure condition to service levels
- **Risk-Based Prioritisation** - Focus resources where they matter most

## Key Capabilities

### Asset Inventory

Maintain a complete, accurate record of your infrastructure:
- Spatial location (points, lines, polygons)
- Physical attributes (size, material, age, capacity)
- Condition history and deterioration curves
- Relationships between assets (parent/child, networks)
- Document attachments (photos, drawings, warranties)

### Condition Assessment

Systematic approach to understanding asset condition:
- Standardised condition rating scales
- Mobile apps for field assessments
- Photo documentation with geotagging
- Assessment scheduling and tracking
- Deterioration modelling and forecasting

### Lifecycle Planning

- Remaining useful life calculations
- Renewal and replacement planning
- Maintenance optimisation
- Capital planning scenarios
- Long-term financial projections
