## PyConZA 2023 Conference Report

Kartoza staff members Admire and Eli recently got the chance to attend the annual PyConZA conference in Umhlanga, Durban. This two-day event organised by the Python community, featured outstanding talks and insightful presentations. The hybrid format enabled attendees to join either in person or online, providing the flexibility to engage with both guests and presenters during the conference in person and online.

Admire Nyakudya, one of Kartoza's resident Python experts, gave a well-attended talk on *Leveraging Python in Geospatial Applications*. Admire discussed and provided some practical demonstrations on how he uses Python during development and in the geospatial industry to automate repetitive tasks and create custom solutions to resolve challenges related to working in remote environments.
